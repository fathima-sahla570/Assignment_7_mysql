This assignment focuses on fundamental SQL operations and user-defined functions (UDFs) for handling and manipulating data in relational database tables.
It demonstrates the use of advanced SQL features, such as adding columns, creating functions, and performing complex queries, while working with the Country and Persons tables.

The tasks include:

Table Modification: Adding a new column DOB (Date of Birth) to the Persons table to store date-based data, enabling age calculation.
User-Defined Function: Creating a reusable function to calculate the age of individuals based on the DOB column.
Querying Data: Writing a query to fetch the calculated age of all persons using the custom function.
String Manipulations in SQL:
Finding the length of each country's name in the Country table.
Extracting the first three characters of each country's name.
Converting country names to uppercase and lowercase formats.
Through this assignment, students gain hands-on experience in database design, advanced query formulation,
and practical application of string and date functions, enhancing their SQL proficiency for real-world database management.
